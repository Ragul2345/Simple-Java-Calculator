Simple Java Calculator -  A simple and interactive command-line calculator written in Java. 
                          This program performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation.
                          It's perfect for beginners who want to learn Java fundamentals like user input, control flow, and operators.

How It Works ? 
              The program prompts the user to input two numbers.
              Then, it asks the user to choose an operation: +, -, *, /, or ^.
              A switch statement matches the chosen operator and performs the operation.
              The result is calculated and printed in the terminal.
              If the user enters an unsupported operator, an error message is displayed.
